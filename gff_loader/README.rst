Python GFF sequence loader
===========================

Setup
------
This python script depends on external libraries, namely:

* `GFFutils <http://github.com/daler/GFFutils>`__, for parsing GFF file
* `pyfasta <http://github.com/brentp/pyfasta>`__, for extracting subsequence

Both packages are easy-installable::

    $ easy_install GFFutils
    $ easy_install pyfasta

Usage
------
Just locate the GFF file and the FASTA file, and then run the script.
